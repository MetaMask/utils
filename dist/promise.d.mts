 *
 * However, be very careful that you have handled the Promise if you do this. Suppressing these
 * errors is dangerous, they exist for good reason. An unhandled rejection can hide errors, making
 * debugging extremely difficult. They should only be suppressed if you're confident that the
 * Promise is always handled correctly, in both the success and failure cases.
 *
 * @param args - The arguments.
 * @param args.suppressUnhandledRejection - This option adds an empty error handler
 * to the Promise to suppress the UnhandledPromiseRejection error. This can be
 * useful if the deferred Promise is sometimes intentionally not used.
 * @returns A deferred Promise.
